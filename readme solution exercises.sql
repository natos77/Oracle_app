The AWR report for your database highlights some significant issues, mainly the following:

Key Problem:
High Scheduler Wait Time:

The event "resmgr
quantum" consumed 83.1% of DB time (153,719 seconds of total wait time).
This event occurs when Oracle's Resource Manager restricts CPU usage due to set resource plans, which could mean CPU resources are under contention, leading to high wait times for processes to get CPU time.
CPU Utilization:

DB CPU consumed 15.8% of DB time (29,136 seconds), indicating the CPU is being used heavily, but the CPU resources may be insufficient for the current workload.
Top Wait Events:

Besides the CPU quantum issue, other foreground events like ASM IO for non-blocking poll, cursor: pin S wait on X, and cell single block physical read contribute much smaller amounts to the total DB time, meaning they aren't critical in comparison to the CPU resource issue.
--
--Potential Solution:
Review Resource Manager Plans:

Check and adjust Oracle Resource Manager settings to ensure that resource allocation is fair. You may need to modify the resource plans to allocate more CPU resources to high-priority workloads.
Increase CPU Resources:

The current CPU capacity may not be sufficient for the workload. Consider scaling up the CPU resources if the system supports it or optimizing application queries and workload to reduce CPU consumption.
Query Optimization:

Review high-consuming SQL queries and optimize them to reduce CPU usage and improve efficiency.
Monitor Background Processes:

Since background CPU usage is very low (almost 0%), focus on the foreground processes. Addressing the CPU quantum wait issue should be the first priority.
